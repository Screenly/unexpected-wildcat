        celery crash data with flower","description":{"raw":"**Description**\nCelery
        has been intermittently and intermittently stopping for shopify in the past
        month, causing the app to cease working and business disruptions for all users.
        We need to prevent it from doing so (see T3050), but to do so, we need to
        figure out what is actually causing the crashes. The best way to do this will
        be to collect as much data as possible when (if) celery stops again. We are
        installing flower (see T3049) to monitor celery for shopify and provide data
        on celery. We should use this to collect data in the event of a stoppage.\n\n**Acceptance
        Criteria**\nSee Giuseppe''s comment. Not sure right now. Collect everything
        you can through flower if\/when there is a crash, anything that seems relevant
        or interesting to you\n\n**Resources**\nSee the following related tasks:\nT3049
        - flower install\nT3050 - celery crash\n\n**Notes**\n- This task only covers
        collection of the celery crash data, not the analysis. Hence the 1 point complexity.
        Analysis will come later, and hopefully give us what we need to estimate and
        fix T3050\n- In the event that no stoppage happens during this sprint (sprint
        15), we can mark this done, and disregard it (in the event a stoppage happens
        later, we can collect data and reopen this ticket)"},"authorPHID":"PHID-USER-rbmakob2u5heiub2dckt","ownerPHID":null,"status":{"value":"open","name":"Open","color":null},"priority":{"value":90,"subpriority":0,"name":"Needs
